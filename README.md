# Multilayer Perceptron

## Overview
This project enables the user to create a neural network (multilayer perceptron). It makes use of the Mathnet nuget package for all of the linear algebra (for feedforward and backpropagation).

## XOR Problem
The specific implementation of the multilayer perceptron in this project is to solve the XOR problem. This is a simple, non-linearly separable problem. The neural network learns the percentage chance of the output being a 0 or a 1 based on 0&1 inputs.
